-  This folder contains the main notebook `mnist-main.py` for running training of a small neural network (`Linear` + `ReLU` + `Linear`) with features from the diffusion model. To launch the code you will need `diffusion.py`, `unet.py`, and `smallnet.py` files from `scripts` folder.

<br>

-  Script `supervised.ipynb` contains code to compare performance of supervised model (resnet18) with our method (unsupervised diffusion model).
